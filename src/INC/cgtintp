c..cgtintp common for include

c..number of tests to make for rezoning
      integer*4 ntests
      parameter( ntests = 9)

c..	try(n,k) is a set of trial functions which control rezoning
c..	trymin(n) is the minimum value, below which deletion occurs
c..	trymax(n) is the maximum value, above which addition occurs
c..	between these the zoning is left alone
      real*8 try(ntests,kdm),trymin(ntests),trymax(ntests)

c..	iad(n,k) =1 if a zone is to be added, else 0
c..	ide(n,k) =1 if a zone is to be deleted, else 0
c..	in both cases, n denotes which test criterion was used
      integer*4 iad(ntests,kdm),ide(ntests,kdm)

c..	ctry is a symbol for each test criterion
