c BEST MEASUREMENT OF THE GRAVITATIONAL
c CONSTANT.  At this week's American Physical Society Meeting in
c Long Beach, Jens H. Gundlach of the University of Washington
c (paper P11.3) reported a long-awaited higher precision measurement
c of the gravitational constant, usually denoted by the letter G. 
c Although G has been of fundamental importance to physics and
c astronomy ever since it was introduced by Isaac Newton in the
c seventeenth century (the gravitational force between two objects
c equals G times the masses of the two objects and divided by their
c distance apart squared), it has been relatively hard to measure,
c owing to the weakness of gravity.  Now a group at the University of
c Washington has reduced the uncertainty in the value of G by almost
c a factor of ten.  Their preliminary value is G=6.67390 x 10^-11 
c m^3/kg/s^2 with an uncertainty of 0.0014%. Combining this new
c value of G with measurements made with the Lageos satellite
c (which uses laser ranging to keep track of its orbital position to
c within a millimeter) permits the calculation of a brand new, highest
c precision mass for the earth: 5.97223 (+/- .00008) x 10^24 kg. 
c Similarly the new mass of the sun becomes 1.98843 (+/- .00003) x
c 10^30 kg. Gundlach's (206-543-4080, jens@phys.washington.edu)
